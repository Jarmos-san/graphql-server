# GraphQL-Server: The Simplest GraphQL Server Solution for Prototyping Your Software

This is a work-in-progress project to create a simple GraphQL server to be used while
prototyping your software & related products. This simple server is supposed to be spun
up on your local system & used thereafter to recreate a local temporary version of your
production GraphQL server on the cloud.

## Getting Started With Using GraphQL-Server

If you need to use GraphQL-Server on your local system, here are the following ways you
can get it on to your system:

1. The _**recommended**_ approach is to quickly download & spin it up & access the server
   on `localhost`. If you prefer using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to set things up,
   invoke the following command:

   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/Jarmos-san/graphql-server
   ```

2. If you don't have Docker installed or don't want to use it for whatever reason, then
   your other option is to use `pip`. To download GraphQL-Server using `pip` ensure you've
   Python installed & then invoke the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install graphql-server
   ```

**NOTE**: The project is still heavyily work-in-progress & hence hasn't been published anywhere yet!
